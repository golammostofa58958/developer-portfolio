            <h2>Become a web developer</h2>
            <p>I started my coding journey almost exactly a year ago and now I'm working full time and doing freelance
                projects on the side for my friends. You may have noticed from my portfolio, but I'm obsessed with
                unique, interesting design and user-friendly functionality so hit me up with your weird artistic project
                ideas or app proposals.</p>

                <p>I work as a contractor developing Wordpress websites for healthcare companies in the US. Wordpress
                    and
                    PHP have really highlighted the value of open source projects and I'm eternally grateful for the
                    people
                    who contribute to them!</p>

                <p>I'm working as a Junior Software Engineer (Infrastructure) at Rose Rocket. Juno taught me how to
                    share my
                    projects, skills, and story with employers and helped me land my dream job. It's been an amazing
                    journey!</p>
